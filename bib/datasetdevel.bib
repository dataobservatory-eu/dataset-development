	abstract = {A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready for analysis, but there has been little research on how to make data cleaning as easy and effective as possible. This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},

	abstract = {As statistical data is inherently highly structured and comes with rich metadata (in form of code lists, data cubes etc.), it would be a missed opportunity to not tap into it from the Linked Data angle. At the time of this writing, there exists no simple way to transform statistical data into Linked Data since the raw data comes in different shapes and forms. Given that {SDMX} (Statistical Data and Metadata {eXchange}) is arguably the most widely used standard for statistical data exchange, a great amount of statistical data about our societies is yet to be discoverable and identifiable in a uniform way. In this article, we present the design and implementation of {SDMX}-{ML} to {RDF}/{XML} {XSL} transformations, as well as the publication of {OECD}, {BFS}, {FAO}, {ECB}, and {IMF} datasets with that tooling.},
